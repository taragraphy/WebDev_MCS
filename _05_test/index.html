					<p class="content-subheading-container">Since the 1970s, the artist has made baffling changes in her work while at the same time developing a consistent oeuvre. Her artistic practice comprises photography, film, painting and works on paper, yet her central interest is in the potential of sculpture, in the sculptural aspects and the architecture of things.</p>

				<div class="content-column-1">Through May Museion hosts TEETH, GUMS, MACHINES, FUTURE, SOCIETY, the first solo show in Italy by the french artist Lili Reynaud-Dewar.
				The exhibition is presented in the spacious area on the fourth floor of Museion. Amidst science-fiction and rap music, imposing layouts and disorder, the exhibition comes across as one large installation comprising a range of different elements such as video, film, panels and objects. Everything revolves around two interconnected themes. On one hand, the so-called grills, teeth decorations that are a status symbol in rap and hip hop culture, that the artist provocatively appropriates. The fact of using grills to modify part of the anatomy in turn recalls another key element of the show, the essay A Cyborg Manifesto by the feminist Donna Haraway. Published in 1985, the essay calls for a move beyond a binary mindset based on dichotomies such as nature/culture, man/woman, right/wrong, truth/illusion and self/other, envisioning a future without discrimination. The other works on display include a new video created in Bolzano for the exhibition.</div>
				<div class="content-column-2">The starting point and core of the show is the eponymous film TEETH, GUMS, MACHINES, FUTURE, SOCIETY (2016), shown on a large screen. White cushions scattered on a black carpet give visitors somewhere to sit and watch the film, which shows the preparation and staging of a performance in Memphis, Tennessee.
				On the stage of the city's famous "Levitt Shell" amphitheatre, excerpts from Donna Haraway's manifesto are recited, while four local stand-up comedians improvise on the text. In the performance, the white, European artist uses this specific historical and socio-cultural background, and the four comedians, to tackle the issue of appropriation and transmission of a status symbol like grills - dental ornaments made of precious metals.</div>
				<div class="content-column-3">Grills thus emphasise the teeth and their special position between the outside and inside of the body, between the public and private dimensions. More broadly speaking, they are also a subverted image of the American dream. Grills are also physically present in the exhibition - 12 handmade pieces in gold, silver and silver-plated gold - and as oversized installations that serve as waste bins.
				Reynaud-Dewar's interest in grills as a "cybernetic" prosthesis and element of social emancipation connects up to the 1985 essay by Donna Haraway entitled A Cyborg Manifesto. Albeit ironically, the feminist manifesto deploys the cyborg as a metaphor for eliminating the dividing lines between human, machine and nature, heralding a chimeric fusion in which boundaries of class, race and sex no longer apply. </div>
